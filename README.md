# WordPress Automation with Python Fabric
This repo is a collection of functional scripts and utils for working with WordPress websites hosted in various locations on the interwebs. The collection is abstracted from my more specific scripts from a library I use and maintain at my day job. As such, some of the scripts may be abstracted...poorly. 

Use at your own risk! (but if there is an issue, open a ticket and I'll address it)
